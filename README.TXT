Project: Library Book System 
                          
              Description:
              
              Java program to create book objects within a 
              book class and add them to different libraries of the library class; thus simulating simply a library inventory.
              
              Also contains call methods for book titles, authors, and subjects as well a call method for the library class
              to reveal the current amount of books in the given library and a method to add book objects to a library object
             
              Future Work:
              
              Implementing main method calls so the project and code will work as a standalone .jar file
              More features for the books and libraries including a method to print all books, titles, and authors in a given               library.
