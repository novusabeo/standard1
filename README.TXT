Project: Library Books
            
Description:  For submission to the Galvanize Admission Portfolio Standard1
              
              Purpose:
              Classes and Objects within this project were coded from scratch. My intention with the project is apply some of               my basic Java knowledge to a new challenge and learn new ways of interacting Classes and objects to create a                   more uniform, useful program that applies concepts that are new to me.
              
              Use:
              Simple Java program to create book objects within the 
              book class and add them to different libraries of the library class; thus simulating simply a library inventory.
              Also contains call methods for book titles, authors, and subjects as well a call method for the library class
              to reveal the current amount of books in the given library and a method to add book objects to a library object.
              
              Execution:
              Runs in BlueJ with JVM -- my knowledge of creating an executeable jar file is limited, though I did learn about
              main method calls and how to begin adapting code such as this to a useable, deployable format. 
              
              Challenges:
              Main Challenges were trying to adapt this code from a BlueJ environment where a GUI makes objects and classes                 easily modifiable to a jar file that can be executed standalone. I realized this is far more complicated and                   deserves its own research and attention to accomplish. 
              
              I was also challenged to find a way to make the Library class interact with Book class objects and returned to                 some old textbooks and online resources to accomplish this.
