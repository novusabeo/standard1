Project: Library Book System 
                          
              Description:
              
              Java program to create book objects within a 
              book class and add them to different libraries of the library class; thus simulating simply a library inventory.
              
              Also contains call methods for book titles, authors, and subjects as well a call method for the library class
              to reveal the current amount of books in the given library and a method to add book objects to a library object
              
              Challenges:
              
              Making the Library class interact with Book class objects to act as an inventory took some research. Ultimately,               arrays came to the rescue and I implemented this into the Library class to act as a system for adding Book                     objects to Library objects.
              
              Need to learn more about main method calls for implementing this code as its own executable .jar file.
